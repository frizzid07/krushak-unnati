A system to produce a better selling rate for the produce to the farmers using unique features like Dynamic Bidding, Best Crop Suggestor, Crop Disease Detector, etc.

The proposed solution will provide the farmers with useful data and services to help them sell their produce at a better rate. The feature of real-time inventory visibility at the distribution centres will assist the farmer in making an informed decision and accepting the most profitable bid. Communication with the farmer can be established through SMS. Using live time weather data, market trends and terrain information, best crop suggestions will be provided. In case of infected plants, the system provides a functionality to detect diseases through the picture of infected plants. The farmer will be able to get an estimate of his profits for the current yield by using the Farm Profit Calculator module. The portal will be available in multiple regional languages to reach a larger demographic.
